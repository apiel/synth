# synth

- modulation
    - there should be only one lfo, reseted only on synth 0
    - create a random drop modulation
    - on each phase could change freq start...

- save synth settings
    - in the 6 default spot
    - but give the possibility to save in extra spot or load from extra spot
- save synth into a raw wavetable

- arbitrary wave, load from file

- envelop:
    - should there be a knob for ADSR
    - or should there a single knob with multiple presets... and eventually the option to have custom ADSR
